The Bar chart design inspiration was taken from revenue bar charts shared by companies and the colour scheme green and red is to show positve profit and negative profit.
The geographic graph was inspired from map charts included in revenue powepoints showing which countries are profits being earned and being lost, the green and red colour schem was also appliedd onto the all the states in the US to higlight which states are profitable for acertain product.
A dropdown for all the states was inserted into the to free space instead of showing all the states name and a slider for the year selection was implmeted to reduce spce being used, and multiple choice tick boxes was used so viewers are able to choose multiple office supplies at the same time to view profits for a specific item or specific items.
